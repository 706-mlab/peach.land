# peach.land

**peach.land** is a NFT + WebXR experimental project being developed by [mingxuan.fun](https://mingxuan.fun/)

Inspired by the ancient Chinese fiction *The Peach Blossom Land*, this experiment is trying to explore the possibilities of a cyberspatial utopia that is based on blockchain and immersive technology.

>The Peach Blossom Spring (Chinese: 桃花源記; pinyin: Táohuā Yuán Jì; lit. 'Source of the Peach Blossoms', also translated as “(The Record of) the Peach Blossom”), or Peach Blossom Spring Story or The Peach Blossom Land, was a fable written by Tao Yuanming in 421 CE about a chance discovery of an ethereal utopia where the people lead an ideal existence in harmony with nature, unaware of the outside world for centuries. (From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Peach_Blossom_Spring))

**Currently this project is pre-alpha**, which means to be a "testing ground" as related tech matured. It lacks many features for now, and anything could change in the future development.
