      <p><strong>peach.land</strong> is a NFT and WebXR experimental project being developed by <a href="https://mingxuan.fun/" target="_blank">mingxuan.fun</a></p>
      <p>Inspired by the ancient Chinese fiction <em>The Peach Blossom Land</em>, this experiment is trying to explore the possibilities of a cyberspatial utopia that is based on blockchain and immersive technology.</p>
      <p><strong>Currently this project is pre-alpha</strong>, which means to be a &quot;testing ground&quot; as related tech matured. It lacks many features for now, and anything could change in the future development.</p>
