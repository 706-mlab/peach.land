      <p><strong>peach.land</strong> is a NFT and WebXR experimental project being developed by <a href="https://mingxuan.fun/" target="_blank">mingxuan.fun</a></p>
      <p>Inspired by the ancient Chinese fiction <em>The Peach Blossom Land</em>, this experiment is trying to explore the possibilities of a cyberspatial utopia that is based on blockchain and immersive technology.</p>
      <p><strong>Currently this project is pre-alpha</strong>, which means to be a &quot;testing ground&quot; as related tech matured. It lacks many features for now, and anything could change in the future development.</p>
      <p><strong>This project is now used as a simple case study for the online course <a href="http://intermediart.caa.edu.cn/2021/09/02/%e7%ba%bf%e4%b8%8a%e8%af%be%e7%a8%8b%e6%8a%a5%e5%90%8d-%e5%85%83%e5%ae%87%e5%ae%99%e6%a6%82%e8%ae%ba%ef%bc%9a%e6%96%b0%e4%b8%96%e7%95%8c%e7%9a%84%e6%b2%89%e6%b5%b8%e4%b8%8e%e5%88%9b%e9%80%a0/">Metaverse: How to create and immerse into a different world</a> organized by China Academy of Art.</strong> Feel free to join the <a href="https://discord.gg/Mxjq43QxHd">Discord</a> for further learning materials.</p>      <p><strong>On PC: use WASD or arrow keys for movement<br>On Mobile: press and drag screen for movement<br>On VR: use controller sticks for movement</strong></p>
